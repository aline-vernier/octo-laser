3rd pass in PowerAmplifier
- 8CMs should be enough in incoupling chamber

Beamlevel
- uniformely at 200 mm (input/output chamber, fiber)
- enter the postcompression chamber at 200mm and rise the beam with a custom made periscope to 250 mm

Chamber
- Mechanical stability:
-- feets for breadboard: 50 mm in diameter
-- breadboard thickness: 30 mm
- plexiglass covers!

HCF
- !! what is the minimal distance the HCF should have to the chamber


Beamblocking
- Beamstabilization system needs the beam before it can stabilize
-- Attenuation before chamber and blocking the fiber entrance. After Beamstab started, open the HCF and increase energy.
-- Alternatively: Find a material that can be inserted before HCF. Ceramic; At 5° to increase damage threshold

Windows
- many windows in incoupling/outcoupling chamber
- window in outcoupling chamber separating HCF to chamber. From inside
- entrance to postcompression chamber: at brewster angle, thick (4 bar, (3 bar rel -> vac))

Beamalignement
- outcoupling chamber: near and far field 

Attenuation
- 1 attenuator before incoupling chamber; should be motorized for better reproducibility
- 1 attenuator in outcoupling chamber. (Maybe 2?)

Diagnostics
-Input Chamber
-- Wizzler: Measurement by replacing the two mirrors following the CMs by wedges and exiting the beam to the front, or to the side (DM50)
-Focus
-- Focus: Attenuation same as Wizzler, then instead of HCF a windows + CCD (Do we need an easier solution for this?)
- Beamstabilization: Piezomorror feedbacked by a leak from the last mirror. FemtoStab seems to work for this configuration, but at the limit.


Prepulse
- mirror partly coated to let prepulse through
- or spatial seperation
- needs to be seperated after CMs, no space to compress both pulses

Attofrog
- how to do it? There needs to be a polarization rotating periscope
- need to readjust the beam (near and far field!)
