INSIDE MAIN BEAM

- recollimation optics (divergent + convergent silver mirror)
- lambda/4 waveplate (soon as possible after fiber, minimum aperture 20mm)
- 3 attenuators (p-pol)
- Brewster window (outcoupling -> compression chamber)
- NONATTOFROG:
-- wedgepair (translation motorized)
-- periscope
-- near + farfield correction (motorized!) (close after fiber)
- ATTOFROG:
-- wedgepair (translation + rotation motorized)
-- rotating periscope (after wedges)
-- lambda/2 waveplate (after wedges)
-- near + farfield correction (motorized!) (fiber + wedges)
- diagnostics for near and farfield (after near + farfield correction)
- 6 CMs @ 5° (p-pol)
- 6 CMs @ 19° (p-pol)
- pickoff for CEP (preferable after CMs)
- shutter (after pickoff for CEP) (+ flip if shutter gets too hot)
- prepulse pickoff (after shutter)
- beamexpanding telescope (after CMs + att. + shutter)
- deformable mirror (after telescope)
- pickoff for SH wavefront sensor (after deformable mirror)
- pickoff for FROG (after CMs, before shutter) (could be also taken from the 
- HeNe injection
